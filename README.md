# Machine Learning Course Project: Predicting the quality of physical exercise

This repository contains the rmd file predicting.Rmd which contains the source code for the compiled index.html version of the analysis report.

Please note that the source data is not included in the repository, because it was not a requirement to recompile the analysis report based on the rmd file. If required the source data can be downloaded from the course web site. To compile the report the paths would have to be updated in predicting.rmd.

The gh-pages based version of the report can be viewed under http://sebastianstoll.github.io/MachineLearningCourseProject/
